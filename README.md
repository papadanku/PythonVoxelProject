# PythonVoxelProject

My Python Project of 2025.

I am creating a Voxel Engine by following Coder Space's tutorial *Creating a Voxel Engine (like Minecraft) from Scratch in Python* (https://youtu.be/Ab8TOSFfNp4?si=FFn7I_9NbLBeh8gh)

There are some differences, despite (mostly) following the tutorial. This version does includes different variable names and (mostly) LLM-generated docstring comments to help the user understand how this stuff works.
